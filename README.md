# Matrix-Multiplication-using-multiple-threads
Develop a C program to multiply two Matrixes using threads. Use POSIX Pthreads for implementing the threads. Your program must follow the following steps to get the inputs from the user. 1. Ask the user for the dimension of the first matrix. 2. Ask the user for the dimension of the second matrix. 3. Check whether the two matrixes are multipliable. 4. If they are multipliable a. Ask the user to select one of the following options • Fill the matrix with the values given in a file • Fill the matrix with random values b. Measure the computation time for the following two options • Multiply the two matrices using a single thread • Multiply the two matrices using multiple threads Write a report providing an analysis of computation time for the two options; single thread and multiple threads. Explain how you divide your matrix multiplication problem into multiple threads.
